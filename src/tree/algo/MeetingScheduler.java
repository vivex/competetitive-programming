     *Design a meeting scheduler. One way is to use an array to represent each interval,
     *like every 15 mins. Although it provides O(1) look up, if interval is small,
     *it seems like we are wasting a lot of space. Any alternative approach that can save space?
     *If we keep a sorted array of meetings sorted by start time, look up will be O(logn),
     *but inserting the new meeting in the middle of the array will require shifting elements, which is O(n).
